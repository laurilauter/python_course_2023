    Find the average of a, b, c and d, but first the numbers must be multiplied. a multiplied by 1, b multiplied by 2,
    c multiplied by 3 and d multiplied by 4.
    After the multiplication find the average of the numbers and print it out.

    Example 1
    a = 0
    b = 0
    c = 0
    d = 4

    Output
    4

    c = 5
    d = 1
